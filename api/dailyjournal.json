I'm really enjoying learning all the ways javascript powers our project and I love figuring out a way to solve the challenges this assignment presents. New things I've learned from googling this weekend: modal pop-ups, hiding elements until needed, more about flex properties, APIs, and I got a little more clarity on ERD's by helping a fellow student. Overall, great weekend! Excited for the week ahead.",
